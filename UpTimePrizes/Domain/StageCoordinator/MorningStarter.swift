//
// Build 33 experiment (founder, 2026-09-25, "option one"): a Dismiss on the
// AlarmKit lock screen starts the morning's song straight away, while the
// phone is still locked. The app's UI is not needed for that — it shows the
// running stage whenever the person opens it.
//
// The audio player and stage coordinator live here, one instance each, so
// the lock-screen intent and the app's screens drive the same morning.
