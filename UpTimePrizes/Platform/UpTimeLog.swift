// Unified logging for the alarm path. Swift print() never reaches the device
// syslog in release builds; os.Logger with public formatting does — which is
// what makes the founder's USB routine work: phone on the cable, the agent
// streams `idevicesyslog` from the PC and verifies the morning against the
// spec without anyone touching the phone.
//
// Messages that the routine matches on are stable, greppable prefixes:
// [ALARM], [AUDIO], [MORNING], [SEED].
