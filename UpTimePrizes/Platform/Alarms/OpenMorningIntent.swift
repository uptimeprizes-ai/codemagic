// MARK: - OpenMorningIntent
//
// Runs when the person taps Dismiss on the AlarmKit lock-screen alarm. It
// stops the ring and starts the morning's song at once — on the lock
// screen, without unlocking (build 33 experiment, founder "option one").
// The app shows the running stage when opened; the morning counts, and the
// Prize screen appears, from there.
//
// The start request is persisted as well as posted: when the tap cold-
// launches the app, the post can land before the UI is listening, so the
// app also consumes the persisted request once it is ready. A request is
// honoured only while fresh, so a stale tap can never start a later morning.
